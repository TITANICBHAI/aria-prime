 * what the AI engine actually does, how on-device learning works, what's real vs stub,
 * and what each component contributes.
 *
 * Accessible from Settings → "Knowledge Base" nav card.
 * Full-screen, no bottom nav bar.

REASONING — The LLM reasons about what it sees and produces a justified action (the 'reason' field in the JSON). It can handle unexpected screens by reasoning from first principles.\n\n3. MEMORY — Past experiences are retrieved and injected into every prompt. ARIA knows it has tried this before, and what happened.\n\n4. ADAPTATION — If stuck, ARIA changes strategy (tries Back, then a different path, then scrolls). It does not loop on the same failed action.\n\nEXAMPLE of agentic vs bot behaviour:\n  Bot: \"If screen = home screen, tap Gmail\"\n  ARIA: \"I see a home screen. My goal is to send email.

ACCESSIBILITY TREE EMPTY\n  Cause: game, Unity, Flutter, or WebView app with no a11y nodes.\n  Symptom: ARIA types Wait repeatedly, never taps anything useful.\n  Fix: enable SmolVLM + MobileSAM in Modules. Label the key UI elements in the Labeler.\n\n2. WRONG ELEMENT TAPPED\n  Cause: two elements look similar in OCR text (two buttons both labelled \"OK\").\n  Symptom: ARIA keeps tapping the wrong OK.\n  Fix: label the specific element in the Labeler with a unique name.\n\n3. STUCK LOOP (same screen for 5+ steps)\n  Cause: the action isn't registering, or the screen needs a different gesture.\n  Symptom: ARIA keeps clicking the same node, screen doesn't change.\n  Fix: ARIA auto-detects stuck at step 5 (forces Back) and step 8 (aborts). If it keeps happening, record an IRL video of the correct action.\n\n4. LLM PRODUCES INVALID JSON\n  Cause: context too long, model confused by ambiguous prompt.\n  Symptom: action shows Wait with reason 'no action parsed'.\n  Fix: shorten the goal description. Very long goals confuse the 1B model.\n\n5. MODEL NOT LOADED (stub mode)\n  Cause: NDK library not compiled yet.\n  Symptom: every action is a fixed stub output from LlamaEngine.\n  Fix: build the NDK library. See the 'What Needs the NDK Build' page.",
